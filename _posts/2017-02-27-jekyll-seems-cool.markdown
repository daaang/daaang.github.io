I've just got this running along with some custom Sass to give the page
a dark background. I know that some people hate dark backgrounds, but I
hate light backgrounds, and this is my website.

If you're mad that this has a dark background, then perhaps you should
remind yourself that your side already won this war. Basically every
website has a light background, so you should probably be happy about
that and move on with your life.

Me? I can never move on.

I guess I'm saying just be thankful the background isn't some fixed
background gif of twinkling stars. *You're welcome.*

The honest truth is that I'm writing here just to write. Back in my day,
blogs didn't need to have substance, and my day is today.

I guess I'm pretty jazzed about having a dynamically generated static
website. Like, it's pretty cool that I'm writing this in markdown, and
it's even cooler that you won't have the power to write comments.

I'll try to post here whenever I find my way around a problem.
