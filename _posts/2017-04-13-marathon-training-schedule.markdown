At the moment, I'm in the middle of interval training, which is an
eight-week thing, where I do three runs per week and up the intensity
every six runs. There are four intensity levels:

|   | Reps | Sprint time | Rest time | Total time |
|--:|-----:|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
| 1 |   12 |        0:15 |      1:00 |      15:00 |
| 2 |   12 |        0:30 |      1:00 |      18:00 |
| 3 |   19 |        0:30 |      0:30 |      19:00 |
| 4 |   27 |        0:30 |      0:15 |      20:15 |

This Sunday, I'll do my sixth and final run at level 2, and I'll have
levels 3 and 4 to do for the next four weeks. At this rate, my last
interval training run will be Sunday 14 May, so I figure that's a good
time to change gears and start prioritizing marathon training.

At the moment, I'm lifting MWF and running TÞS.

The rule as I understand it is that I should be running about 40 miles
per week in the month leading up to the actual event. Another rule is
that I should be doing at least one long run every week.

I like interval training. I disliked it at first, but I think it's grown
on me as I've done it. One nice thing though, is that it only takes
about 20 minutes. In that time, I can expect to run at least two miles
(probably more as my recovery improves).

So my thought is that I can shift my intervals to MWF (alongside
lifting) and start doing distance runs TÞS. Based on all this, I made a
first-draft schedule for myself:

And we'll see how I feel as time goes on!
