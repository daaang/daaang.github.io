I want to write that testing language, and when you want to write a
language, you write it in llvm. So it's time to learn llvm.

I've decided to learn the bindings for OCaml rather than C++.

Oddly enough, I can't find any internet arguments about which language
is better to use for llvm, so I'm going with the language I don't
already know. I figure it's better to learn two things than it is to
learn one thing?

[I'm putting my code online][1], of course. When I know the world could
be watching, I write better code.

Although at this point I'm just following a tutorial. Should be fun.
