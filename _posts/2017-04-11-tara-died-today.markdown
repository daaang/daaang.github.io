Tara died while sleeping outside in the sun, breathing fresh air and
knowing that Mom was in the other room.

When she was a puppy, I used to lay on the floor next to her every night
until she fell asleep, to help her transition from life with her mother
and siblings to life with my family.

When we crumpled up some paper into a ball and threw it, she crouched
low, crept up on it, and pounced. We never did manage to train her to go
get the paper, but she did learn that if she had the paper in her mouth,
she would get a treat. Sometimes, she'd walk around the house holding
the paper for half an hour.

A dog can teach you a lot about unconditional love.

Tara was born on 10 June 2003, and she died on 11 April 2017, breathing
the first air of spring. We buried her in the front yard with her
favorite toy, a flower, and a rawhide treat.

I love you Tara. Rest in peace.
